Just finished Tile Mess, another 4x4 tile puzzle game. I figured
this time I might as well make it my own instead of for an employer,
as well as putting it in the App Store for myself. It's inspired
from another tile puzzle game I created called "Scrambled," but
for this I had to write it from scratch because I technically
didn't own the other one I built.
