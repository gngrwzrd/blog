title: Android Push with GCM Client Jar Path
truncate: false
---
I've been working on a project that requires Android push notifications.
I've been using Google GCM service because it's really straightforward.
I did however run into an issue that Google had a fix for, but hasn't
released an updated GCM client JAR file.
